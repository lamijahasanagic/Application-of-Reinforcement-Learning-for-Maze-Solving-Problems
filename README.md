Application of Reinforcement Learning techniques on solving maze problems.

## Description

The maze solving problem is an ancient well-known problem solved by human and animals. The problems is defined as finding the shortest path from the starting point of a maze to its end point. To solve the problem Q-learning algorithm was used to move an agent (rat) from its initial starting point, to the final position in the maze represented as a cheese. The algorithm is implemented in a way that visualizes the maze and the movement of the rat, where the rat's behaviour from episode to episode. This means that rat will improve its behavior by gradually exploring the maze and learning from this exploration according to the principles of Q learning, until it finds the shortest path. Once the rat has found the shortest path (when the Q-table converges to the optimal solution), it can exploit the Q table it generated to play the maze game in an optimal way.
